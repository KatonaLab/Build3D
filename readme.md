# Troubleshooting

	Fatal Python error: Py_Initialize: unable to load the file system codec
	ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'encodings'
	
`PYTHONHOME` is not a path to a Python base directory. Use `--python-path` program argument to set to a correct one.

	LNK1181 linker error while compiling on Windows
	
Check your path to the project directory (e.g. `"c:\my projects\A3DC"`), if it contains spaces then probably that is the cause. Remove any spaces from the path. It seems to be an issue with jom.exe, we can not fix it right now.
