# PythImage
PythImage is a wrapper around Christoph Gohlke's Tiffile package. It defines an image class with unified metadata keys as these depend on the Tiff format. The keys are the ones used in the Ome-Tiff format. Currently, only most important metadata are read related to the type, size, and shape. The goal is to create an image class that can be used more intuitively. For example, objects support numpy slicing notation, dimension order can be rearranged etc. Operations that change image shape and type result in changes in the metadata as well. As of now it is still in rudimentary form and is developed as needed. Rigorous testing is still needed before release.
