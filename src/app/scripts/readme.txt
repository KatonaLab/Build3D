To get your module listed in the app please put it in a subfolder and give a name that starts with the "module" word. Also, the extension should be .py.

Examples:
scripts/examples/module_hello.py -> will be displayed under the "examples" submenu with the menu item "hello"
scripts/examples/hello.py -> this file won't be listed in the menu

The files should not be hidden and note that empty folders are not listed.
